# Contributing to Lupin

We welcome any type of contribution to the project, let it be documentation extending, features, code-prettifying.

However, before opening a pull request that includes a major change, we advise you to open an issue about it and let the community and the maintainers decide if they want it. This saves your time, and ours aswell.

Thank you for considering making a contribution to **Lupin**!
